### What is Swagger and Open API Specification
OpenAPI Specification (formerly Swagger Specification) is an API description format for REST APIs. An OpenAPI file allows you to describe your entire API.
Swagger is a set of open-source tools built around the OpenAPI Specification that can help you design, build, document and consume REST APIs.

Over the past few years, Swagger has become the standard for defining or documenting your API. Formerly known as the Swagger Specification, this format has been donated to the Open API Initiative (or OAI) which is a Linux Foundation Collaborative Project.
On July 2017, the OpenAPI Specification 3.0.0 was finally released by the Open API Initiative. This has improved the specifications over the previous ones.
