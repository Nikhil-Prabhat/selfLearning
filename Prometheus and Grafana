Micrometer provides a simple facade to integrate actuator metrices with external monitoring systems and it allowing us to instrument your JVM based application.
It supports several monitoring systems like Netflix Atlas, AWS Cloudwatch ,Datadog, InfluxData,SignalFX,graphite,Wavefront,Prometheus etc.

Prometheus :

Prometheus is an open source monitoring system that was originally built by SoundCloud. It consists of the following core components.
1. A data scrapper that pulls metrics data over HTTP periodically at configured interval.
2. A time series database to store all the metrices data.
3. A simple user interface where you can visualise,query, and monitor all the metrices.

Grafana :

Grafana allows you to bring data from various data sources like ElasticSearch, Prometheus , Graphite, InfluxDB etc and visualise them with beautiful graphs.
It also lets you set rules based on your metrices data. When an alert changes state, it can notify you over email, slack or other various channels.
